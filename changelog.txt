More number display fixes, buttons use onmousedown events for greater responsiveness

Version 0.181 (06/06/2014)
Bugfixes: global multiplier gets recalculated when save imports, numbers that displayed incorrectly have been fixed, some incorrect prices are changed, updating should be a little more responsive

Version 0.18 (05/30/14)

Version 0.17 (05/16/14)
Fixed some graphical bugs, made chart not show more than 100 points, extended number suffixes to a vigintillion, fixed serious bug due to Chrome and Firefox locking updates to once per second while in the background.

Importing and exporting saves is now possible on the Options screen.

Charts are now more responsive, and there's a button to change the axis.

Version 0.14 (04/30/14)
A lot of changes to try to speed up the chart. Toggling actually disables the chart, and it's limited to 100 points. Also, chart updates every 10 seconds instead of every second.

Even more bugfixes, nerfed clicking upgrades again, added a chart in statistics that tracks money for the session.

Version 0.12 (04/28/14)
More bugfixes, split money/tick into actual money per tick and money per autoclick, nerfed autoclickers.

Version 0.11 (04/27/14)
Squashed a lot of bugs, nerfed clicking upgrades, added tier 5 upgrade, modified reset currency gain (in particular mathematician currency gain is clearly visible now). Also, reset, because I screwed up the resetting on the last version.

Version 0.1 (04/26/14)
Added prestige (plus one unlockable derivative) and Click Improver upgrade, and did some rebalancing. Also implemented dynamic savefiles, so hopefully no more resets will be necessary from this point forward (although balance will probably be tweaked).

Version 0.031 (03/31/14)
Changes to the number to buy feature: added buy maximum, button lighting reflects number to buy

Version 0.03 (03/28/14)
Added ability to buy multiple buildings at once, and buffed autoclickers some more.

Version 0.02 (03/20/14)
Balancing changes (buffed autoclickers, nerfed multipliers, changed prices of some things). Also added upper navigation bar.

Version 0.01 (03/18/14)
First actual version, and first version I'd call a complete game.
